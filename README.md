# Digital-Patient-Flow-System
## By Osman Momoh

## What this project does

This is a program for recording patient information, including demographics, vital signs, assessments, and medications.

## Why I made this

As a healthcare professional and computer science student, I was looking for fun personal projects that combine my interests.

## How I made this

This project is written in Java and MySQL. I used the JavaFX library. For the architectures I used MVC and 3-tier architectures.

## How to use it

The SQL folder contains the file necessary for building the SQL tables. In main, uncomment "makeData.createRandomData();" to provide some random data for your MySQL table. Comment this out for subsequent runs. You can login with username: admin, password: pass.

## Final notes

This program is at a beta phase. It runs well, but more features would be necessary before it could be properly implemented.
